# 📊 Codex Career Terminal:Career Launch Arc

Welcome, Strategist. This codex marks the begining of my tactical development. I'm buildinng a modular, RPG-inspired interface that tracks my progress, automates my workflow, and prepares me to land high-impact roles like the Junior Front End Developer Position at GDIT. Through HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I'll Forge a living system-complete Status window with quest logs, skill trees, and AI guidance.
