# ⚔️ Side Quest Log: The Architect's Gauntlet

**Quest ID**: SQ1
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**DP Earned**: +75 DP
**Associated Quest**: [MQ1 – HTML Syntax & Structure]
**Date Completed**: 09/19/2025

## 🎯 Objective

Reinforce core HTML concepts after identifying a knowledge gap in the initial quiz attempt. This quest involved a series of interactive challenges (flashcards) designed to build muscle memory for HTML structure, nesting, and semantic tag usage.

## 📜 Mission Debrief

The gauntlet was a targeted, one-on-one training session focused on the fundamentals of HTML architecture. The challenges covered the following critical areas:

* **The HTML Blueprint:** Correctly ordering the foundational tags (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).

* **Nesting & Closing:** Mastering the "Last-In, First-Out" rule for tag closure to ensure valid markup.

* **Semantic Identity:** Differentiating between semantic tags (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`) and non-semantic containers (`<div>`) to create meaningful document structures.

* **Layout Assembly:** Combining multiple semantic tags to build a logical, self-contained component like a blog post preview.
