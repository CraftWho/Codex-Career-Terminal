## 🧠 Reflection

"Some of the lessons were already familiar, the challenges really helped me understand what the tags actually do with real examples. The Src attribute really makes sense now."

> **System Log [12/07/2025]:** User successfully completed the Google Clone. The skeleton of the web (HTML) is now understood. The user can create input fields, buttons, and display images. The next logical step is applying "skin" (CSS) to this skeleton.
