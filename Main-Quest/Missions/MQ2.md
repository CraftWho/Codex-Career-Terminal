## 🧠 Reflection

> **Mission Debried:**
> This quest marked the transistion from static "brochure" site to a living application. By implementing the Fetch API, I successfully connected the frontend dashboard to a JSON data source (`dp-data.json`).
>
> **Key Learnings:**
>
> - **Asynchronous Logic:** Learned how `fetch()` returns a Promise and how to handle it using `.then()` to ensure data is ready before rendering.
> - **Dom Manipulation:** Moved away from hardcoding HTML content; instead, I'm now using JavaScript to target IDs (`getElementById`) and inject data dynnamically.
> - **Scalability:** The dashboard now auto-updates whenever the JSON files changes, meaning I don't have to touch the HTML structure to level up.
