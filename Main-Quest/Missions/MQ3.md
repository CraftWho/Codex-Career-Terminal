## 📜 Mission Briefing

The "Static Age" is over. To build modern interfaces like the ones at GDIT, you must master the **Component Architecture**.

Your mission is to refactor a piece of your Codex (the Profile Card) into a reusable React component.

### 🛠️ Tasks

1. **Install Node.js & Vite**: Set up your local development environment.
2. **Scaffold Project**: Run `npm create vite@latest mq3-react-lab`.
3. **Componentize**: Take the HTML from your dashboard's "Current Status" section and turn it into a React component.
